						As the evening progressed and it started to get later, Emily's grandma (who she is very close to), was tired and was getting ready to leave. And since Emily had no idea what was to come later on that evening, she kindly helped her grandmother outside to wish her goodnight.

						Fortunately, Travis and Emily's father swept in to successfully coach Grandma into staying! Unfortunately, the stairs were too much for Grandma to climb back up again, so they moved the party downstairs to the garage.
